 Ubuntu image builder
======================

This tool is used to build Ubuntu images.  Currently it only builds Snappy
images from a model assertion, but it will be generalized to build more
(eventually all) Ubuntu images.


Requirements
============

Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) is the minimum platform requirement.  Python 3.5
is the minimum Python version required.  All required third party packages are
available in the Ubuntu archive.

If you want to run the test suite you should install the following
dependencies:

* python3-coverage
* python3-flake8
* python3-nose2
* python3-progressbar
* python3-requests
* python3-requests-oauthlib
* python3-requests-toolbelt
* python3-responses
* python3-setuptools
* python3-ssoclient
* tox

The test suite will prefer system installed libraries when available instead
of PyPI downloaded libraries, however the following test dependencies will be
downloaded from PyPI on demand, since they aren't yet available in the Ubuntu
archive:

* flake8-respect-noqa

Do **not** use `progressbar <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar>`__ from
PyPI because of this `upstream open bug`_.  Just ``sudo apt install
python3-progressbar`` instead.

Developing
==========

You'll need the `tox <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`__ tool to run the
test suite (see above for testing requirements).  You can run the full test
suite, including coverage and code quality tests via::

    $ tox

You can run individual tests like this::

    $ tox -e py35 -- -P <pattern>

where *<pattern>* is a Python regular expression matching a test name, e.g.::

    $ tox -e py35 -- -P test_smoke
